# Automated coronavirus tracking and reporting

This python script tracks and scrapes the data from www.worldometers.info/coronavirus with the end goal of automating coronavirus reporting. The collected data gets exported in a convenient CSV file. You can also integrate twilio to get daily messages containing the coronavirus statistics.

The libraries I've used are: selenium (web automation and scraping), pandas (data manipulation), and twilio (messaging service).
